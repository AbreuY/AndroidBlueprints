# Android Starter App
My architect experience and passion for Android into this project to simplify the creation of a new App for Android.
Instead of configuring everything from scratch we can just import or take inspiration from the features of this project.

> Computer Science is experimentation, automation and engineering (...).

So those Apps are also a playground to experiment new frameworks and new features.
